/*Alice and Bob play a game. They have a binary string s (a string such that each character in it is either 0 or 1). 
Alice moves first, then Bob, then Alice again, and so on.
During their move, the player can choose any number 
(not less than one) of consecutive equal characters in s and delete
 them.The game ends when the string becomes empty, and the score of each player is the number of 1-characters deleted by them.
Each player wants to maximize their score. Calculate the resulting 
score of Alice...*/
